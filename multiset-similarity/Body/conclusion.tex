In this paper we define a new problem named prominent items detection, which has been encountered in many fields but not researched before. To accurately detect prominent items, we propose a new sketch-based algorithm, namely \sketchname{}.
It is the first algorithm that can estimate the persistency and recency of each item in data streams, and it can also estimate the frequency of each item.
We derive the theoretical proofs for the error
bound of the \sketchname{} when it focuses on persistency and recency.
